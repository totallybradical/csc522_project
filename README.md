## CNN

Our main objective for our experiment was to explore the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to classify hot and cold images of Fermi gases. We designed, implemented, and optimized our CNN within MATLAB.

## SNN

Given our inexperience with applied neural networks, we decided to also see how efficient a standard neural network might be in classifying the images. The design, implementation, and optimization of the SNN was done using the Keras library within Python.
